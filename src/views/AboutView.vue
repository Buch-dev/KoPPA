            KoPPA uses cutting-edge technology and a user centered focus in a
            B2B2C model to help users achieve exactly what they may intend. The
            harrowing reality of displacement in the Nigerian work force, where
            graduates of accounting, for example, find themselves in schools
            teaching, is a remote cause of unemployment. Many graduates thus
            become unemployable and unfit for most work places since their
            skills havenâ€™t be rightly applied. We offer a solution that uses
            machine learning to match the right candidates to the right work
            place, and offer matching recommendations to hiring teams. No one
            does it better.
